 * BUSINESS RULE: "R - 03731 Start/End Time Setting/Default"
 * 
 * The combination of Start Date and Start Time must be less than or equal to the current system
 * date and time. If there is not already an existing Assignment Start Date and Start Time, and the
 * Assignment is for a Referral, default the Start Date and Start Time to the Referral Start_Date
 * and Start_Time. No Assignment can exist prior to the Referral Start Date/Time. The Start Date and
 * Time of the first Primary Assignment and the Referral Received Date and Time must be the same.
 * However, if the Assignment is for a Case default the Start Date and Time to the Case Start Date
 * and System Time. The Start Date of the first Primary Assignment and the Case Start Date must be
 * the same. These fields become read only after a save to database.
