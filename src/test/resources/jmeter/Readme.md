## JMeter Tests

JMeter Tests are part of the API project as jmx files eg. *API/src/test/resources/jmeter/CmsReferralLegacyNSComparison.jmx*

Some JMeter Tests are executed as part of Jenkins Continuous Integration after each build of the API project

The User Properties for JMeter are part of the api-deploy project

### CmsReferralLegacyNSComparison.jmx

This test compares a Referral created via the API New System to a Baseline Referral from the CMS Legacy System

The intent is that a referral created via the API New System should be identical to one with the same data created via the Legacy System

A baseline legacy sql is added to ci-seeds to provide a Baseline Referral to test against when this test is executed as part of Jenkins Continuous Integration
